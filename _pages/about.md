**I am planning on applying to graduate school programs to study developmental cognitive neuroscience for admission in Fall 2024!** *Please see the [Research](research.md) tab to learn more about my research interests and career goals.*

As a post-baccalaureate fellow in the Clinical Translational Neuroscience Branch under [Dr. Karen Berman](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/principal-investigators/karen-berman), I conduct research using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both structural and functional, to investigate the impact that hormonal changes during puberty have on the brain. 

I spent two years following my undergraduate education as a post-baccalaureate fellow in the [Section on Functional Imaging Methods](https://fim.nimh.nih.gov/) under [Dr. Peter Bandettini](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/principal-investigators/peter-bandettini). During this time, I worked on a multitude of projects analyzing functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI and how to leverage connectivity information to enhance brain-behavior predictions. 

I received a B.A. in Psychology from  [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) in 2021, where I found my love for neuroscience and coding. I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the [Laboratory of the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory](https://blogs.cornell.edu/davidsmithlab/) under [Dr. David Smith](https://psychology.cornell.edu/david-m-smith), studying the anterior hippocampus using chemogenetics. 

Outside of the lab, I love a good brunch, reading, working out, and watching sports with my family.
